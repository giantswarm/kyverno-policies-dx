    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      ScaledObjects with prometheus or loki triggers should have a fallback configuration to ensure 
      that they can handle cases where these metric-based scalers aren't working in a predictable way. 
      The fallback section defines a number of replicas to fall back to if a scaler is in an error state.
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Audit
  background: true
  rules:
  - name: check-fallback-config
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - keda.sh/v1alpha1/ScaledObject
    preconditions:
      any:
      - key: "{{ `{{` }} request.object.spec.triggers[?type == 'prometheus'] | length(@) {{ `}}` }}"
        operator: GreaterThanOrEquals
        value: 1
      - key: "{{ `{{` }} request.object.spec.triggers[?type == 'loki'] | length(@) {{ `}}` }}"

      message: >-
        ScaledObjects with prometheus or loki triggers must have a fallback config defined. 
        The fallback section should include both failureThreshold and replicas fields to ensure 
        reliable scaling behavior when these metric-based scalers encounter errors.
      pattern:
        spec:
          fallback:
            failureThreshold: "?*"
            replicas: "?*"
